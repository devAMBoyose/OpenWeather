# 🌤️ OpenWeather Dashboard — Full-Stack Weather App

A **real-time weather dashboard** built with **React (Vite)** and **Node.js / Express**, featuring secure API calls, animated icons, and live temperature visualization.  
This project is part of my **Full-Stack Developer Portfolio** under `APIs / Integrations` and demonstrates client–server communication, RESTful architecture, and environment-secured API handling.
